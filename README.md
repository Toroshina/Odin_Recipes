# Odin_Recipes

This project is creating a website that will consist of a main index page, these will link to a few different recipes.

Some skills that have been acquired thus far are creating HTML boilerplate, and understanding of the elements (paragraph, anchor, href, img, unordered lists, ordered lists, headings, title, head, and body) 

Application of these skills will be setting up ordered lists and an image of a dish so users can follow the recipe and create said dish.
